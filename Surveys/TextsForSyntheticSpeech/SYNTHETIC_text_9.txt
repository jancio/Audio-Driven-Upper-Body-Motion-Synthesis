Sarah is very long-sighted. She has only one pair of glasses, which she keeps losing. Today she has lost her glasses again and she needs to find them. She had them yesterday evening when she looked up the television programmes. She must have left them somewhere that she has been today. She asks Ted to find her glasses. She tells him that today she went to her regular early morning keep fit class, then to the post office, and last to the flower shop. Ted goes straight to the post office.
